Some of those alleged worst offenders are important sourcing and business regions for many large US companies such as Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), and Walmart (WMT). China, for example, will see an estimated reciprocal tariff of 34%. Vietnam at 32%. Japan is at 24%. The news has hit stocks, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down about 1,200 points, or nearly 3% (YM=F). S&P 500 futures are down 3.5% (ES=F), and Nasdaq futures are off by 3.8% (NQ=F). Japan’s Nikkei (^N225) and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (^HSI) have also registered significant losses. Here’s the hot analysis investors need to know right now:First, retail stocks are getting battered. Walmart, Nike, and Under Armour (UAA, UA) are getting slammed as steep tariffs on China could hammer profits. Nike, for example, relies on China and Vietnam for 55% of its sourcing. Stifel analyst Jim Duffy estimates Nike could see $1.69 a share in earnings wiped out this year because of tariffs. Next up, Apple is going to have a rough day: Morgan Stanley estimates that the tariffs on iPhones and other devices from China will increase Apple’s annual costs by a whopping $8.5 billion. That could hit Apple’s profits by 52 cents next year. Brutal. And lastly, the technical takedown: Market technicians are locked in on the S&P 500’s March 13 closing low of 5,527.50. At this moment, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is poised to test that low. A break through below the March lows intraday coupled with a new closing low could really damage sentiment further pros warn. RBC strategist Lori Calvasina says the S&P 500 has a clear shot to 4,900 if that low is breached.

2025-04-02 10:00:55,Tariffs are the last thing apparel industry needs: Rebecca Minkoff,"Retailers are getting swept into the black vortex that are tariff headlines from the Trump administration. Big names such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Gap (GAP), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) have warned about the impact of tariffs this year on profits. In the meantime, shoppers are growing concerned about what they will be paying for spring and summer apparel once tariffs kick in. The reality is that consumers may resist the higher prices, sending retailers off to offer profit-busting discounts and earnings warnings. Luxury goods companies are by no means immune to the challenges as their results have been powered by international shoppers and a wealthy class feasting on strong stock market gains (until now). Is there any reason to be optimistic about the sector? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with noted fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff for her perspective on the state of retail. Minkoff created her company from the ground floor in the mid-2000s and has seen some of the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows in retail. Minkoff is also the author of the new book Fearless: The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, Courage, and Success, where she aims to impart leadership wisdom to the next generation of female entrepreneurs.
