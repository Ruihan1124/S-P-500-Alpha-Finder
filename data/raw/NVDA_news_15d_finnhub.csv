Take blockchain, crypto and Web3 – three areas that continue to see their fair share of startups seeking to make their names. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Mysten Labs co-founder and CEO Evan Cheng. Cheng has spent good chunks of time in tech leadership roles at Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META).
